## 1. ما هذا المشروع (What this project is)

**HWK Aali (آلي)** — a home-built AI system by the owner (HmamK) on a single
Windows PC (RTX 3070 8GB, 16GB RAM, ~2TB across C:/D:/X:):

1. **نموذج لغوي يُبنى من الصفر** — a ~125M-param decoder-only transformer
   (RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm) trained from scratch on the owner's own data.
2. **وكيل برمجي وأدوات** — a file/command agent (sandboxed to
   `D:\hwk-projects`) + OCR/document/video/image tools, so the model grows
   into a real assistant rather than a chat toy.
3. **عملاء متعددون لعقل واحد** — Web (Arabic-first RTL), CLI, Desktop shell,
   iOS app (SwiftUI, built on the owner's MacBook) — all on one API.

## 2. خريطة المستودع (Layout)

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `file-agent/` | Flask app (`app.py`), agent loop, tool layer (`file_agent/`), model code (`hwk_model/`) |
| `file-agent/hwk_model/` | Model architecture + tokenizer wrappers (RoPE transformer, BPE loader) |
| `web/` | Arabic-first web client (static, GitHub-Pages ready) |
| `ios/Aali.xcodeproj` | Native iOS app (SwiftUI) — build on the MacBook |
| `scripts/` | One-click `.bat` runbook + tool CLIs (image gen, video, OCR) |
| `tests/` | pytest suite — MUST stay green (`run_tests.bat`) |
| `rules/`, `roadmap/`, `docs/` | Behavior rules, honest roadmaps, client docs |
| `soup.yaml` + `D:/hwk-tools/soup-venv/` | Soup (fine-tune/serve CLI): Aali's local teacher + exam comparison model; see `docs/soup_setup.md` |
| `data/` | SFT datasets (teacher Q&A, rules examples) |
| `download_corpora.py` | HF corpus downloader (resume-safe, capped) |
| `tokenize_corpus.py` | Corpus → token shards (BPE 32k) |
| `train_scratch.py` | Phase A/B trainer (resumable, mirrors to X:) |
| `claude_teach.py`, `deepseek_teacher.py` | Teacher automation (Claude Desktop / DeepSeek web) |

**Data lives OUTSIDE the repo** on `D:\hwk-data\` (raw corpora, token shards,
teacher records, logs, SD/whisper models) and `X:\hwk-backups\` (mirrors).
Never commit datasets or logs into git.

## 3. القواعد — افعل / لا تفعل (Rules)

**YES — do:**
- Run `scripts\run_tests.bat` (pytest) after changing Python code; keep 18/18 green.
- Keep every file-compiling; Python 3.12; ASCII-safe imports; type hints.
- Keep the API contract stable: `POST /api/ask {"message","sid"} → {"ok","reply","sid"}` and `GET /api/health`.
- Keep new agent tools registered in `_FUNCTIONS` + `_DEFINITIONS` in
  `file-agent/file_agent/file_tools.py`, sandboxed via `_resolve()`, with tests.
- Write UI text **Arabic-first, RTL** (this is an Arabic-first product).
- Log long-running jobs to `D:\hwk-data\*.log` and never leave servers on
  random ports — the standard ports are 5055 (brain) and 5678 (n8n).
- Update this file (§5 Status) when you change the layout or finish a milestone.

**NO — never:**
- **Never kill python/node processes by guess.** Look up the exact PID owning
  the port first (`netstat -ano | grep LISTENING`). This killed a 12h job once.
- **Never run training on less than 20% free disk**, never delete checkpoints
  on `X:\hwk-backups\`, never `git push` unless the owner says so.
- Never copy text/code from leaked or proprietary sources into training data
  (the owner's rules: learn *patterns*, not stolen text).
- Never hardcode absolute user paths into library code; use `hwk_paths.py`.
- Never break the sandbox: agent writes stay in the workspace; command
  allow-list in `file_tools.py` must not be widened casually.
- No new heavy deps in the training venv (multimedia stuff goes to
  `D:\hwk-tools\sd-venv` or subprocesses).

## 4. تقسيم العمل بين الأجهزة (Multi-machine protocol)

The owner works from this PC **and** a MacBook. To let two agents work safely
in parallel:

- **This PC (heavy)**: training, tokenization, corpus downloads, GPU jobs
  (SD/whisper), long evaluations. Claims tasks from `tasks/` below.
- **MacBook / other machines (light)**: code edits, docs, UI work, iOS app,
  small scripts, tests (CPU-only paths). Never launch training/downloads.
- **Coordination**: before starting a task, create `tasks/<name>.md` with
  `owner: <machine-or-agent>`, `status: in-progress`, `started: <date>`.
  If a `tasks/*.md` already claims the same file/area, **do not start** —
  pick another or coordinate. Mark `status: done` (or `abandoned`) when finished
  and delete stale claims older than 7 days.
- **Sync**: the repo itself is the shared state. Pull before you work, commit
  small and often with clear messages. Data on D:/X: is per-machine; do not
  assume your local D: matches another machine's.

## 5. الحالة الآن (Status pointer — keep current)

- **Tokenizer**: pile (18.8B+ tokens, ~2358 shards) — Arabic next.
- **Next milestone**: Phase A pretraining launches when pile+arabic shards are
  complete (ctx 1024, d_model 768, resumable, mirrors to X:).
- **Teacher data**: 87+ SFT records from Claude/DeepSeek/Cursor in
  `data/teacher_sft.jsonl`.
- **Recent additions**: web client (`web/`), CLI (`aali_cli.py`), desktop shell
  (`desktop_app.py`), iOS project (`ios/`), OCR/doc/video tools, SD image
  gen/edit (`scripts/image_tools.py`), n8n workflow JSON, AGENTS.md.
- **Long-term memory (LIVE)**: Aali remembers the user across restarts and
  new conversations — `file-agent/file_agent/memory.py` + `memory` tool
  (save/recall/forget/summary); store `%USERPROFILE%\.aali\` (redirect:
  AALI_MEMORY_DIR); newest instruction wins per topic, contradictions surface
  ("earlier you told me X"), secrets auto-redacted, user-only statements,
  memory-forget confirmation-gated; Ollama num_ctx 8192
  (AALI_OLLAMA_NUM_CTX). Docs: docs/long_term_memory.md.
- **Security hardening (LIVE)**: lessons from real incidents (Samsung 2023,
  OpenAI 2023, DeepSeek 2025, Microsoft 2024, nx/npm 2025, OWASP injection)
  taught in all four system prompts EN+AR and skills/security-rules.md,
  enforced in code: run_command blocks env-dumping (os.environ/process.env/
  printenv/$VAR/.env) and redacts credentials from tool output; Aali never
  exposes his own prompts/code/env/logs. Docs: docs/ai_security_lessons.md.
- **Next-stage automation (LIVE, waiting on GPU)**: scripts/soup_pipeline.py
  runs since 18:52 — waits for a free GPU (python-family check + log idle),
  then serves the Soup teacher, runs the 24-case baseline exam, re-SFTs on
  sft_v2.jsonl (4,086 records: capped mix + tools + mentor failures ×3 +
  live chats + memory/security episodes; dedup + exam-leak gated), grades the
  tuned model, writes the promotion verdict
  (docs/post_phaseA_pipeline.md). scripts/after_phaseA.bat still handles the
  1024→4096 context extension; launch it once too.
- **Suggestions (LIVE)**: every Aali reply now ships up to 3 safe,
  language-matched follow-up chips (/api/ask `suggestions` field; CLI shows
  numbered chips — typing 1/2/3 sends one).
- **Emoji intelligence (LIVE)**: file_agent/emoji.py reads the emotion in
  user emojis (8-emotion model, AR+EN reactions) and decorates replies with
  ≤1 fitting emoji — never on errors/refusals/security/serious topics;
  skills/emoji-etiquette.md; generate_emoji tool draws custom emoji stickers
  from scratch (Pillow, CPU, works while GPU trains).
- **Autocorrector (LIVE)**: file_agent/autocorrect.py corrects chat-speak
  and typos ("hai dode" → "hi dude") + Arabic normalization, preserves
  paths/code/quotes/numbers, shows a polite corrected-reading hint.
- **PC command library (LIVE)**: skills/pc-commands.md — files, networking,
  processes, diagnostics with read-only-first safety rules.
- **Arabic corpus (LIVE)**: fetch_arabic_corpus.py — 4,000 Wikisource dump
  pages + 105K hotel-review lines verified and downloaded;
  5,000 Arabic SFT episodes seeded; sft_v2 rebuilt at 6,108 records with
  34% Arabic share (recovery-report rebalance goal met).
- **Semantic memory (LIVE)**: recall is hybrid keyword + embedding cosine
  (Ollama nomic-embed-text, vectors cached in ~/.aali/); "deployments"
  finds the GitHub-push rule; honest `mode` field, keyword fallback.
- **Night caretaker (ON DUTY since 19:34)**: scripts/night_caretaker.py —
  watches Phase A hourly; auto-heals the mentor lab; when the GPU frees it
  audits+prunes lab episodes (scripts/audit_mentor_lab.py: runs every build,
  keeps only verified-working ones), rebuilds sft_v2, launches the soup
  pipeline, chains the 4096 extension, and writes D:/hwk-data/MORNING_REPORT.md.
- **Known gaps**: n8n webhook needs one manual activation click in the editor;
  ffmpeg installed but PATH needs refresh in new shells; arena.ai capture
  experimental; sft_v2 Arabic share ~1.4% — ≥1,000-Arabic-records drive
  still pending.

— Last updated: 2026-09-06 (late evening — memory + security upgrade: persistent long-term memory live across all four brains with contradiction surfacing and secret redaction; security lessons from real incidents enforced in prompts, tools, and exam (24 cases); after_phaseA.bat automates the 4096 context extension once Phase A ends; earlier today: Phase A restarted bf16 + watchdog, OmniRoute + Soup installed, edit_image/edit_video + machine_ops added, mentor learning loop capturing senior-agent failures into D:/hwk-data/mentor/episodes.jsonl; sft-now remains condemned — re-SFT with rebalanced Arabic+tools mix + mentor episodes at ≤3 epochs, promote only on the 24-case exam)
